I am uploading a photo and I need you to create an editorial-style illustration inspired by Monocle magazine. Use only the following palette:  
- Black #000000 for outlines  
- White #FFFFFF for base fills  
- Mid Gray #999999 for shading focus items  
- Exactly one pastel highlight color, chosen randomly from:  
  • Salmon Peach #F7C8B7  
  • Dusty Blue #B8C6DB  
  • Blush Pink #EEC9D2  
  • Pale Beige #E9E3D0  

Keep the style minimalist with simplified geometric shapes, flat fills, and balanced composition. Apply subtle ink-like line texture, as if printed or drawn with a charcoal pencil, so it feels slightly organic instead of digitally perfect.  

Avoid gradients, photorealism, smooth vector-perfect lines, multiple highlight colors, or cluttered detail.  

The result should feel elegant, iconic, and print-ready for a modern magazine layout.
